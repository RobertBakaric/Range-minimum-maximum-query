rmmq version 1.01
=======================

NAME:

Range Minimum Maximum Query


SYNOPSIS:

    #include<vector>
    #include<rmmq.hpp>
 
    vector<int|long|unsigned|double> vec {1,5,23,7,8,3,12,5,3,44,56};

/* sparse table */
    /* Construct */
    ST<int|long|unsigned|double> sptab(vec);
    /* OR */
    ST<int|long|unsigned|double> sptab;
    sptab.make(vec)
    
    /* Explicite Destructor */
    sptab.destroy();



    
/* rmmq */
    /* Construct */
    RMMQ<int|long|unsigned|double> rmmq(vec);
    /* OR */
    RMMQ<int|long|unsigned|double> rmmq;
    rmmq.make(vec)

    /* Explicite Destructor */
    rmmq.destroy();
  




    /* Range Minimum Query for (5,3) */
    /* return value */
    rmmq.MinVal(5-1,3-1); // returns 7  (-1 is for vector index positions since indexing starts from 0)

    /* return position */
    rmmq.MinPos(5-1,3-1); // returns 3 since indexing starts from 0 (-1 is for vector index positions since indexing starts from 0)

    /* Range Maximum Query for (3,5) */
    /* return value */
    rmmq.MaxVal(3-1,5-1); // returns 23  (-1 is for vector index positions since indexing starts from 0)

    /* return position in array */
    rmmq.MaxPos(3-1,5-1); // returns 2 since indexing starts from 0 (-1 is for vector index positions since indexing starts from 0)


DESCRIPTION:

Given an array of numbers (a) and two position i,j\in [1,|a|], program computes the minimum and/or maximum position and/or value within the interval specified by the two numbers (i and j).



CONSTRUCTION AND RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:

Complexity for n = |a| (number of elements in a given array):

    Construction:  O(n log n)
    
    Retrieve:    O(1)
